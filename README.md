# EasyOptimization (EO)

A lightweight, all-in-one Windows performance optimizer tailored for low-end PCs (old laptops, entry-level desktops), designed to eliminate lag and boost system efficiency without hardware upgrades.

## Overview

EO solves common pain points of low-end Windows devices (slow boot, laggy multitasking, limited storage, network delays) through a **4-in-1 solution**:

`Cleaning + Optimization + Real-Time Monitoring + Practical Tools`

It runs with minimal resource usage (≤20MB size without dotnet runtime) and supports one-click operations for beginners.

## Key Features

### 1. Deep Cleaning: Free Up Storage & Lighten System Load

Targeted at storage bloat on low-end devices:



* **Junk File Scan**: Detect and clean system temp files, browser caches, download residues, and expired Recycle Bin files.

* **Registry Maintenance**: Scan invalid entries (uninstalled software residues, broken associations) + one-click cleaning/backup to avoid registry bloat.

* **Disk Optimization**:


  * HDD: Efficient defragmentation to reduce head seek time and speed up file read/write.

  * SSD: TRIM optimization to protect lifespan.

### 2. HOST File Editor: Customize Network Rules

Visual tool for safe HOST modification (no manual system file editing):



* **Ad & Malware Blocking**: Import rules to block pop-ups, video pre-roll ads, and phishing websites (saves traffic, speeds up browsing).

* **Access Acceleration**: Add/import optimal IP mappings for frequent sites (e.g., office servers, video platforms) to bypass DNS delays.

* **Safety Guarantees**: One-click backup/restore of HOST configurations to avoid network errors from misoperations.

### 3. Precision Optimization: Maximize Hardware Utilization

Customized for low-end CPU/memory/graphics:



* **Startup & Service Manager**: Visualize and disable redundant startup programs/background services (shorten boot time, reduce memory use).

* **System Tuning**: Auto-adjust virtual memory, process priority, and disk cache to focus resources on active tasks.

* **Intelligent Memory Release**: Auto-free memory from idle background apps when available memory is low (ensures smooth document editing/browsing).

* **Network Fix**: Optimize TCP/IP, clear DNS cache, and repair connection issues (reduces network lag).

### 4. Real-Time Resource Monitoring

Lightweight panel to track system status and troubleshoot bottlenecks:



* **Multi-Metric Display**: Real-time CPU, memory, disk (usage/read/write speed), and network (upload/download) data (line chart/numerical modes).

* **Process Ranking**: Sort running processes by resource usage to identify "hogs" + one-click termination of unresponsive apps.

* **Alarm Settings**: Custom thresholds (e.g., CPU > 80%) trigger pop-up/sound alerts to prevent system crashes.

### 5. Practical Toolset

No extra software needed—built-in lightweight tools:



* **Enhanced Task Manager**: Force-terminate stubborn processes + view details (file path, resource history).

* **File Shredder**: Overwrite sensitive files (old docs, residual installers) for irreversible deletion (frees space + protects privacy).

* **System Info Detector**: Display hardware specs (CPU, memory, disk type, GPU) and system version/patches (helps target optimizations).

* **Quick Command Box**: One-click execution of common system commands (disk check, network repair, system restore) — no manual input.

## Core Advantages



* ✅ **Lightweight**: ≤10MB size, minimal memory usage (no extra burden on low-end PCs).

* ✅ **Easy to Use**: Full Chinese interface + one-click core functions (no professional skills required).

* ✅ **Safe**: All operations include backup/restore to avoid system failures.

* ✅ **Free Forever**: No ads, no paywalls for core features.

## Getting Started



1. Download EO from the official channel (ensure Windows 10/11 compatibility).

2. Launch the app.

3. Use "One-Click Optimization" for quick performance boosts, or explore individual modules for targeted tweaks.

## Notes



* For SSDs: Avoid frequent defragmentation (use TRIM optimization instead).

* Backup HOST configurations before editing to restore network access if needed.
